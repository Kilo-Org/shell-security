# @kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor

An [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) plugin that runs a security checkup of
your OpenClaw instance and returns an expert analysis report from
KiloCode cloud.

The plugin takes the output of `openclaw security audit`, sends it to
the KiloCode Security Advisor API for analysis, and returns a detailed
markdown report with findings, risks, prioritized recommendations, and
concrete remediation guidance, displayed directly in your chat.

## Install

```bash
openclaw plugins install @kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor@dev
openclaw plugins enable openclaw-security-advisor
openclaw gateway restart
```

> **Why `@dev`?** No stable release has shipped yet — only dev snapshots
> (`0.1.0-dev.N`). The `@dev` tag is currently the only working install
> path. Plain `openclaw plugins install @kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor`
> (without `@dev`) **will fail today** with a prerelease-guard error,
> because npm's `latest` dist-tag still points at a dev version on
> pre-stable packages. Once the first stable release (`X.Y.Z`) ships,
> you'll be able to drop the `@dev` suffix and use the plain command.
> See [Channels](#channels) below.

On first use, the plugin will walk you through a one-time device auth
flow to connect your KiloCode account.

### Channels

The plugin ships on two npm dist-tags:

- **`latest`** — public stable releases (`X.Y.Z`). Default for plain
  `npm install` / `openclaw plugins install`. Will exist once the first
  stable release ships.
- **`dev`** — internal dogfood snapshots (`X.Y.Z-dev.N`). Install with:

  ```bash
  openclaw plugins install @kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor@dev
  # or
  npm install @kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor@dev
  ```

  Dev releases are real npm publishes with the same provenance
  attestation as stable releases (verify with `npm audit signatures`).
  They're "internal" only by social convention and by being on a
  non-default dist-tag — there's nothing technically restricting access.

You can also install an exact version directly:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @kilocode/openclaw-security-advisor@0.1.0-dev.1
```

---

## Usage

The plugin exposes two entry points. They do the same thing; pick whichever
fits your workflow.

### `/security-checkup` (recommended)

Type it in chat:

```
/security-checkup
```

This is a slash command. It runs the plugin directly and renders the
full report, bypassing the agent's summarization layer entirely. **Use
this for guaranteed verbatim output.**

### Natural language

You can also just ask the agent:

> Run a KiloCode security checkup

> Check my OpenClaw security

> Audit my OpenClaw config

The agent will call the `kilocode_security_advisor` tool and the report
will appear in chat.

**Heads up:** natural language invocation goes through your configured
language model, which may rewrite or summarize the report before
showing it to you. This works well on capable models (GPT-4o, Claude
Sonnet, Gemini Pro) but small summarizing models (e.g. GPT-4.1-nano,
Haiku) will often paraphrase the report down to a few sentences. **If
you're running a small or summarizing model, use the
`/security-checkup` slash command instead.** It renders the full
report regardless of which model is configured.

---

## First run authentication

The first time you run the checkup, you'll be prompted to connect your
KiloCode account:

```
## Connect to KiloCode

To run a security checkup, connect your KiloCode account.

1. Open this URL in your browser:
   https://app.kilo.ai/device-auth?code=XXXX-XXXX

2. Enter this code: XXXX-XXXX

3. Sign in or create a free account

Once you've approved the connection, run the security checkup again.
```

Open the URL, sign in (or create a free account), and approve the
connection. Then run `/security-checkup` again. The plugin will pick
up the approval, persist your auth token, run the checkup, and return
the report in the same response.

> **Note:** after the token is saved, OpenClaw briefly reloads to apply
> the new credential. You'll see a short connection blip in the chat
> UI. This is expected and only happens on first auth. Subsequent
> checkups run instantly without any reload.

For every run after the first, no auth prompt appears. The saved token
is reused automatically.

---

## What gets sent

The plugin sends the following to the KiloCode Security Advisor API:

- The JSON output of `openclaw security audit` (local config audit
  results, with no secrets, no file contents, just finding IDs and
  summaries)
- Your OpenClaw version and plugin version
- The public IP address of your instance (used for optional remote
  probes)

The plugin **does not** send:

- Your OpenClaw config file contents
- Secrets, tokens, or API keys
- Conversation history or chat data
- Files from your workspace

All requests are authenticated with your KiloCode account token over
HTTPS.

## Configuration

The plugin reads its config from `openclaw.json` under
`plugins.entries.openclaw-security-advisor.config`. In most cases, you
won't need to set anything. The defaults work out of the box.

| Field        | Default                | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `authToken`  | _(set by device auth)_ | Your KiloCode auth token. Managed automatically by the plugin.          |
| `apiBaseUrl` | `https://api.kilo.ai`  | KiloCode API base URL. Override only if you run a self-hosted KiloCode. |

To override via the OpenClaw CLI:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-security-advisor.config.apiBaseUrl https://your-kilocode.example.com
```

### Environment variables

The plugin also respects these environment variables, useful for
non-interactive setups (CI, containerized deployments):

- `KILOCODE_API_KEY`: if set, the plugin uses this as the auth token
  and skips the device auth flow entirely. Intended for environments
  where an operator has already injected the key at boot.
- `KILO_API_URL` or `KILOCODE_API_BASE_URL`: override the API base URL
  without touching the plugin config.

Plugin config takes precedence over env vars; env vars take precedence
over the default.

## Troubleshooting

**"Your KiloCode authentication has expired"**
The plugin automatically clears expired tokens and reruns the device
auth flow on the next invocation. Just run `/security-checkup` again.

**"Security analysis failed: Rate limit exceeded"**
The KiloCode API rate limits security checkups per account. Wait a
little and try again.

**Natural language invocation paraphrases the report**
This is a limitation of small summarizing language models, not the
plugin. Use `/security-checkup` (the slash command) to bypass the model
entirely and render the full report.

**Plugin doesn't appear in `/plugins list`**
The `/plugins` slash command in OpenClaw chat is gated by a separate
OpenClaw setting. To enable it:

```bash
openclaw config set commands.plugins true
openclaw gateway restart
```

The plugin itself works without this setting. It's only needed if you
want the `/plugins list` chat command to show installed plugins.

**The gateway restarts after device auth**
This is expected on first auth: the plugin writes your token to the
OpenClaw config, which triggers a one-time gateway reload. Subsequent
checkups don't reload.
